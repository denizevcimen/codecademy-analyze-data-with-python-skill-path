# Life Expectancy By Country
Over the course of the past few centuries, technological and medical advancements have helped increase the life expectancy of humans. However, as of now, the average life expectancy of humans varies depending on what country you live in.
In this project, we will investigate a dataset containing information about the average life expectancy in 158 different countries. We will specifically look at how a countryâ€™s economic success might impact the life expectancy in that area.

```python
import codecademylib3_seaborn
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_csv("country_data.csv")
print(data.head())

life_expectancy = data["Life Expectancy"]

life_expectancy_quartiles = np.quantile(life_expectancy, [0.25, 0.5, 0.75])

gdp = data["GDP"]
median_gdp = np.quantile(gdp, 0.5)
low_gdp = data[data["GDP"] <= median_gdp]
high_gdp = data[data["GDP"] > median_gdp]


low_gdp_quartiles = np.quantile(low_gdp["Life Expectancy"], [0.25, 0.5, 0.75])
high_gdp_quartiles = np.quantile(high_gdp["Life Expectancy"], [0.25, 0.5, 0.75])
print(low_gdp_quartiles)
print(high_gdp_quartiles)


plt.hist(high_gdp["Life Expectancy"], alpha = 0.5, label = "High GDP")
plt.hist(low_gdp["Life Expectancy"], alpha = 0.5, label = "Low GDP")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
